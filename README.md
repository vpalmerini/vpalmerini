### Hi, I'm Victor! :computer: :v:

### About Me

I'm a software engineer and I truly believe in the power of technology and how it can change lives. I'm also an open-source and Linux enthusiast :)

### What I have a good knowledge :octocat:

I have some experience with both `frontend` (React) and `backend` (NodeJS | Django) fields and also a little bit with `devops` (Docker | CI/CD). I like all those fields but lately I've been focusing more on backend stuff.
