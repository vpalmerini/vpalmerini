### Hi, I'm Victor! :computer: :v:

### About Me

I'm a software engineer and also a Computer Science student at [UNICAMP - University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/). I truly believe in the power of technology and how it can change lives. I'm also a open-source and Linux enthusiast :)

### What I have a good knowledge :octocat:

I have some experience with both frontend (React) and backend (Django | Express) fields and also a little bit with devops (Docker | GitLab Enterprise). I like all those fields and my goal is to learn even more about all of them.

### What I'm trying to learn :moneybag:
Recently, I have started to code a little bit with Go and TypeScript. DevOps tools like Kubernetes and Prometheus also have been part of my routine :rocket: If you have any suggestion of good resource for these languages/tools, please send it to me :)
